OceanHackWeek Q&amp;As

## Purpose
A place for asynchronous help on data and software in the ocean sciences community. 
We plan to start scheduling monthly sessions where we can work through these questions together.

## Scope
* Oceanographic data
* R or Python programming languages


## How to use this repository?
* Search the repository for the question/topic of interest.
* If nothing exists, add an issue to describe your topic and include a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE).
  * If a MRE is more unwieldy than can fit in the body of an issue, add MRE to `datasets/` via PR.
* Iterate and document with the community.
* Share!
