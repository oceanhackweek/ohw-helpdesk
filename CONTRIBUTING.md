### Issues

#### Create a new issue

 If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-helpdesk/issues). Include enough information for someone to be able to assist you.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw-helpdesk/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](#labels) for more information. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to contribute to the conversation in the ticket and/or open a PR with a fix.

#### Labels

### Make Changes

## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

### Your PR is merged!
